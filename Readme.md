Hi! 

This repository contains the Drowsiness Detection deep learning model and the final web application.

First of all, download/clone the repo!

The [`app7_images.py`](https://github.com/chromerai/Drowsiness-Detection_Web_App/blob/main/app7_images.py) is the final app that you need to run.

The command to be used is: `streamlit run app7_images.py`

The final Detection system is in: [`DDS-model.ipynb`](https://github.com/chromerai/Drowsiness-Detection_Web_App/blob/main/DDS-Model.ipynb)   

The training and creation of the baseline model : [`Basleine_model.ipynb`](https://github.com/chromerai/Drowsiness-Detection_Web_App/blob/main/Baseline_model.ipynb).  

The training and creation of [`'my_model.h5'`](https://github.com/chromerai/Drowsiness-Detection_Web_App/blob/main/my_model.h5) : [`Project_drowsiness_detection.ipynb`](https://github.com/chromerai/Drowsiness-Detection_Web_App/blob/main/Project_Drowsiness_Detection.ipynb)



You can access the final report here : [`Final Report`](https://github.com/chromerai/Drowsiness-Detection_Web_App/blob/main/Drowsiness%20Detection%20Project%20Report.pdf)
You need to install various modules:  
`python : 3.8.5`.  
The following modules version's should be compatible with python:3.8.5 :    

opencv-python. 

tensorflow. 

numpy. 

dlib. 

imutils. 

winsound.

streamlit. 

The start page should look like this :

The `demo1.mp4` file is just a sample file, you should(or can) upload your own file or even can use webcam, however make sure that the webcam is sufficiently close to your face at the time of starting the webcam through the `use webcam` button on the web-app.

The project was created in a group of 3 as a final year undergrad project.
